Horizontal pixels are measured from the bottom, with the lower-most
pixel being the 1st pixel, and the top-most pixel being the 8th. Vertical
pixels are measured from the left. Line thickness precedes the character
description.

“Partial” means that the bounds of the glyph do not go to the edges of its
bounding box (e.g. it uses none of the outer-most 30 pixels).
